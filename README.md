# points

Alice performs an action.  In return she is rewarded points from the points source.

It is useful to keep track of her activity, on a daily, weekly, all time basis e.g. quantified self.

Points can be transferred back to the points source, creating cycles.

Interesting side effect: points can be transferred.  But why would you want to?

Given the web credits balances traditionally dont fall below zero, how to seed the points source becomes a question.

Points can be double spent as both record keeping and financial incentives.
